        - high operating flexibility\nNone\n- conventional power plant with / without\
        \ CHP\nIn a combined cycle power plant, a gas turbine is followed by a steam\
        \ turbine. The dataset refers to a combined cycle power plant of 400MWe class\
        \ with a gas turbine 260MWe and a steam turbine 140MWe.\n- combined cycle\
        \ power plant with / without CHP\nCO is a result of incomplete burning. For\
        \ economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions\
        \ are low. CO2 and SO2 emissions are dependent on the composition of the used\
        \ fuel. Due to the low sulfur content of the used natural gas, no desulfurization\
        \ has to take place.\nNOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power\
        \ plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx\
        \ emissions in literature are correspondingly large.\nAt the moment, these\
        \ datasets differ in nothing but the efficiency. High voltage electricity\
        \ (at the busbar) is the reference product,  whereupon heat is a by-product\
        \ in CHP plants. Out of all fossile fuels, natural gas holds worldwide the\
        \ highest share of CHP plants besides peat. Furthermore, natural gas power\
        \ plants are today often designed with combined cycles. This dataset is for\
        \ the natural gas, combined cycle power plant without CHP.The advantages of\
        \ a combined cycle power plant are for example:\n- lower emissions due to\
        \ higher efficiency\nFor electricity production with natural gas, four different\
        \ datasets relying to different power plant types exist:\nThe efficiency calculations\
        \ are based on Central Electricity Authority (CEA) statistics (fuel input\
        \ vs. electricity/heat produced) and own calculation assumptions. Reducing\
        \ factors such as contaminations of important plant parts, cooling conditions\
        \ or part load have been taken into account. Even if efficiencies vary with\
        \ different surrounding temperatures, temperature adjustments would be related\
        \ to high uncertainties.\nOrganic compound emissions are estimated on the\
        \ basis of EPA 1998. \nDifferent sources served as basis for assumption of\
        \ average emissions. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into\
        \ account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining\
        \ data gaps. The emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NO2, SO2, and Particulates have\
        \ been collected/calculated from India specific sources. The other emissions\
        \ have been collected for the former UCTE region* and have been taken over\
        \ as such for all countries (uncertainty adjusted accordingly). See ecoinvent\
        \ report 'Erdgas' given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15). In the following\
        \ a short overview:\nThis dataset represents the production of high voltage\
        \ electricity in a {{power_plant_type}} in {{location}} (a state/union territory\
        \ in India) in {{time_period}}. This dataset is created as a child of the\

        \ and some are country-specific. Following values are edited, because they\
        \ are country specific: the annual production volume, input of fuel, thermal\
        \ efficiency of the power plant, emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NO2, SO2, and\
        \ Particulates.\nWater is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam\
        \ circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is\

          this dataset. Decarbonised water is considered to be always used as cooling
          water, thus cooling water fractions to air are applied to all carbonised
          water input flows to calculate the amount of water consumed in the processes.

          harvesting systems, e.g. in datasets on national forestry, this parameter
          is NOT the productivity of the harvesting system but the productivity of
          the system weighted with the share of the amount harvested by the respective
          system. This has to be calculated outside EcoEditor. Own calculations based

        comment: 'referring to stemwood; IMPROTANT NOTE: When considering several
          harvesting systems, e.g. in datasets on national forestry, this parameter
          is NOT the productivity of the harvesting system but the productivity of
          the system weighted with the share of the amount harvested by the respective
          system. This has to be calculated outside EcoEditor. Own calculations based

      comment: "The dataset represents the production of 1 Kg hard coal in Australia.\
        \ Australia has the fourth largest share of coal reserves in the world. Most\
        \ of the coal  is exported. 77 % of  the nations coal production was shipped\
        \ overseas in 2013-14.In Australia, nearly 80 per cent of coal is produced\
        \ from open-cut mines. The dataset represents data from both opencast as well\
        \ as underground mines.In Australia black coal occurs in all states, but Queensland\
        \ (63 per cent) and New South Wales (23 per cent) have the largest share.\n\
        This dataset represents the production of 1 kg hard coal (useable output)\
        \ in the specific region with an energy content of 20.1 MJ/kg pit coal. Life\
        \ time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 100 years of\
        \ life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land after operation\
        \ is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land recultivation is\
        \ not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation of land is\
        \ expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies on material\
        \ flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational areas for\
        \ infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Land\
        \ use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data\
        \ regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher\
        \ uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements\
        \ are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total\
        \ production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10\
        \ kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative\
        \ for single mines or specific conditions. \nGeography:  Region specific.\n\
        In Australia black coal occurs in all states, but Queensland (63 per cent)\
        \ and New South Wales (23 per cent) have the largest share.\nTechnology: \

        \ seams are much thinner but in most cases up to 20 seams are located one\
        \ above the other. In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the\
        \ seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines\
        \ often lorries and bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard\
        \ coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather\
        \ hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of\
        \ explosives are required.\nUnderground mining: In underground mines seam\
        \ thickness ranges from 0.7 to 5 meters. It is also possible to extract seams\
        \ which are located one upon the other. Seams with a thickness below 0.7 meters\
        \ can not be mined cost effectively. Depths range from below 100 meters u\
        \ to 1000 meters. \n\nIn this dataset it is assumed that the total amount\
        \ of coal is treated, particularly for export coal high calorific values and\
        \ low sulfuric contents are required. Data regarding mine waste is based on\
        \ Hinrichs. \n\nIn this dataset a processing efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast\
        \ mining) and 92 % (underground mining) is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled\
        \ or disposed. Energetic use of flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion\
        \ is not included in the dataset due to insufficient information and insignificant\
        \ amounts; assuming complete utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter\
        \ can be recycled.\n\n\nTime period:  The data has been collected from 2015\
        \ -16 onwards and are estimated to be valid till 2020"

        \ 1.March 2018\n\nFurther modeling choices and assumptions include:\n\u2022\
        \tIn order to enable a consistent calculation of the cumulative energy demand,\
        \ the extracted mass of raw coal was adjusted by a factor of 1.03, taking\
        \ into account the difference in the upper heating value of raw coal of this\
        \ region (19.7 MJ/kg), compared to the used worldwide average of 19.1 MJ/kg.\n\
        \u2022\tMine reclamation is not included in this module, because it mostly\
        \ concerns the tailings, which are described in a separate module. \n\u2022\
        \tElectricity, heating from heavy oil industrial boilers, and diesel uses\
        \ are included. The use of the module \"heat, at hard coal industrial furnace\
        \ 1-10MW\" leads to an underestimation of emissions, because the quality of\
        \ coal burned at mines is usually lower than coal burned in industrial boilers\
        \ elsewhere. \n\u2022\tWater uses in mining and coal washing have been approximately\
        \ described using the module \"tap water\". \n\u2022\tRadon emissions are\
        \ recalculated from average value worldwide using the ratio of U content 36/20\
        \ from UNSCEAR 1993. \n\u2022\tMining and preparation related emissions to\
        \ water are estimated for Western European conditions and applied to this\
        \ region. They are assumed to be released to rivers. Possible emissions to\
        \ groundwater have not been accounted for.\n\u2022\tAll coalbed methane released\
        \ from the seam is accounted for as natural gas resource and assumed to be\
        \ entirely emitted to air. The methane recovered in some major mines, possibly\
        \ used for own energetic needs and/or district heating, has not been described\
        \ as an energy byproduct. The unaccounted energy is most likely negligible\
        \ compared to the energy content of the product coal. \n\nUncontrolled coal\
        \ fires occur when coal deposits in untapped coal beds, in active or abandoned\
        \ underground coal mines or in waste dumps of open pit mines ignite. This\
        \ can happen spontaneously, for example when coal is exposed to oxygen and\
        \ hot sunlight. Coal fires already occurred in prehistoric times, ignited\
        \ for example by volcanoes. Today completely spontaneous fires without human\
        \ involvement are less common (K\xFCnzer & Stracher, 2011). Song and K\xFC\
        nzer (2014) estimate that Chinese coal fires accounted for 40% of GHG emissions\
        \ from coal fires in 2002. At that time China also mined about 40% of global\
        \ hard coal. In absolute terms, van Dijk (2011) estimates that a maximum of\
        \ 20 million tonnes of coal is burnt in uncontrolled fires in China per year.\
        \ Song and K\xFCnzer (2014) point out that given the investment in firefighting\
        \ efforts over the past years this number may meanwhile be significantly lower.\
        \ However, no more recent quantitative estimate is available to confirm that.\
        \ For other geographies we carefully evaluated the available data and found\
        \ them insufficient to make reliable estimates. For this reason, China continues\
        \ to be the only geography in ecoinvent which accounts for the impacts of\
        \ coal fires in the hard coal mining activity. While this is consistent with\
        \ previous versions of the database, it is an important improvement in data\
        \ accuracy. The estimate of 0.33kg CO2/kg of hard coal mined made by Dones\
        \ et al. (2007) for ecoinvent version 2 relied on meanwhile disproved research\
        \ which largely overestimated the significance of coal fires. We calculate\
        \ the current emissions from coal fires based on the conservative estimate\
        \ of 20Mt lost to such fires each year. This means we relate the current annual\
        \ rate of burnt coal seams to the current coal production volumes in China\
        \ and neglect the fact that past mining activities are responsible for the\
        \ coal burning today, while today\u2019s mining activities will be responsible\
        \ for emissions occurring in the near to distant future. The combustion is\
        \ modelled as open burning of the average Chinese coal composition according\
        \ to USGS\u2019s World Coal Quality Inventory (USGS, 2010).  This means, we\
        \ assume complete combustion conditions, while a major share of coal actually\
        \ combusts under a lack of oxygen. Given the current state of knowledge on\
        \ coal fires we consider this the best available approximation. We are eager\
        \ to improve it as better data become available in the future. The amount\
        \ of coal corresponding to the assumed losses of 20Mt/yr has been added to\
        \ the coal resources consumption.\nMethane emissions comprise those resulting\
        \ from coal fires as well as fugitive methane emissions related to coal mining\
        \ activities. (See exchange comment \"methane, fossil\" for more details.)\n\
        This activity describes the mining and preparation of hard coal in China.\
        \ The activity comprises blasting during site development, mine infrastructure,\
        \ additional requirements of steel and wood and electricity supply from both\
        \ an on-site coal power plant, which is fueled with the unprepared raw coal,\
        \ and from the grid. Emissions comprise both, emissions resulting directly\
        \ from mine operation and coal preparation as well as emissions from uncontrolled\
        \ coal fires in China. Please see in the comment of each emission exchange\
        \ where it stems from. Emissions related to the mine operation and coal preparation\
        \ were taken over from a previous version of this dataset for which detailed\
        \ documentation can be found in Dones et al. (2007). Emissions related to\
        \ uncontrolled coal fires were modeled according to the best available information\
        \ in 2017. \nGeography:  Some data taken over from previous versions of this\
        \ dataset are region specific (Shanxi Province and county-wide).\nTechnology:\
        \  Most data related to the mining and preparation activities relies on literature\
        \ from the 1990ies. "

      comment: "This dataset represents the production of 1 kg hard coal (useable\
        \ output) in the specific region with an energy content of 17.3 MJ/kg pit\
        \ coal. Life time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 100\
        \ years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land\
        \ after operation is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land\
        \ recultivation is not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation\
        \ of land is expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies\
        \ on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational\
        \ areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated.\
        \ Hard coal in Latin America is mined in open pit mines, therefore no underground\
        \ mines are taken into account in this dataset. Land use for affected water\
        \ supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are\
        \ not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered.\
        \ In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production\
        \ over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated.\
        \ A total production over life time of 3*10^10 kg is assumed. This figure\
        \ represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or\
        \ specific conditions.\nGeography:  Region specific.\nTechnology:  Compared\
        \ to lignite, hard coal seams are much thinner but in most cases up to 20\
        \ seams are located one above the other. In general seam thickness ranges\
        \ from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters.\
        \ In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and bucket excavators are used.\
        \ Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard\
        \ coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus\
        \ significant amounts of explosives are required.\n \n\nIn this dataset it\
        \ is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly for export\
        \ coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required. Data\
        \ regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. \n\nIn this dataset a processing\
        \ efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining)\
        \ is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of\
        \ flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset\
        \ due to insufficient information and insignificant amounts; assuming complete\
        \ utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.\n\n\nHinrichs\

          to calculate the amount of water consumed in the processes.

      comment: "[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:\n - hard\
        \ coal mine operation, Asia without China, 1990 - 2002 (0a171656-8643-4857-998a-6462bd278a77)]\n\
        This dataset represents hard coal mining in Indonesia based on the ecoinvent\
        \ v2.2 dataset for centrally planned Asia (CPA) with Indonesia-specific production\
        \ volumes and adjusted uncertainty. Average data for coal mining in the specific\
        \ region have been taken from a summary study on material flows and energy\
        \ uses. Data are normalized by the mass unit of produced coal, including preparation\
        \ and without differentiating steam coal from the rest. In order to enable\
        \ a consistent calculation of the cumulative energy demand, the extracted\
        \ mass of raw coal was adjusted by a factor of 1.03, taking into account the\
        \ difference in the upper heating value of raw coal of this region (19.7 MJ/kg),\
        \ compared to the used worldwide average of 19.1 MJ/kg. Mine reclamation is\
        \ not included in this module, because it mostly concerns the tailings, which\
        \ are described in a separate module. Electricity, heating from heavy oil\
        \ industrial boilers, and diesel uses are included. The use of the module\
        \ \"heat, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW\" leads to an underestimation\
        \ of emissions, because the quality of coal burned at mines is usually lower\
        \ than coal burned in industrial boilers elsewhere. Water uses in mining and\
        \ coal washing have been approximately described using the module \"tap water\"\
        . Particle emissions are assumed to be all greater than 10 micrometer. Radon\
        \ emissions are average value worldwide. Methane emissions are based on average\
        \ emission factors according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse\
        \ Gas Inventories (see exchange comment for more details). Emissions to water\
        \ are estimated for Western European conditions and applied to this region.\
        \ They are assumed to be released to rivers. Possible emissions to groundwater\
        \ have not been accounted for. All coalbed methane released from the seam\
        \ is accounted for as natural gas resource. However the recovered methane,\
        \ possibly used for district heating and for energetic needs of some individual\
        \ mines, has not been described as an energy byproduct. The unaccounted energy\
        \ is nevertheless negligible compared to the energy content of the product\
        \ coal (maximum of two percent for underground mining).\n[This dataset is\

        \ years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land\
        \ after operation is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land\
        \ recultivation is not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation\
        \ of land is expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies\
        \ on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational\
        \ areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated.\
        \ Both underground (67%) and open pit mines (33%) in Russia are taken into\
        \ account. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations.\
        \ Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher\
        \ uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements\
        \ are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total\
        \ production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10\
        \ kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative\
        \ for single mines or specific conditions.\nGeography:  Region specific.\n\
        Technology:  Opencast mining: Compared to lignite, hard coal seams are much\
        \ thinner but in most cases up to 20 seams are located one above the other.\
        \ In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located\
        \ up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and\
        \ bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in\
        \ hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations\
        \ have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of explosives are required.\n\
        Underground mining: In underground mines seam thickness ranges from 0.7 to\
        \ 5 meters. It is also possible to extract seams which are located one upon\
        \ the other. Seams with a thickness below 0.7 meters can not be mined cost\
        \ effectively. Depths range from below 100 meters u to 1000 meters. \n\nIn\
        \ this dataset it is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly\
        \ for export coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required.\
        \ Data regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. \n\nIn this dataset a processing\
        \ efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining)\
        \ is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of\
        \ flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset\

        \ utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.\n\n\nHinrichs\

        Data for RU is mostly based on standard data, as only few information on the
        Russian production is available.

        Geography:  Data is based on average data and therefore not specific for the
        country, except for leakage data.

        Technology:  The data describes an average onshore technology for natural
        gas  to 13% out of combined oil gas production. Natural gas is assumed to
        20% sour. Leakage in exploitation is estimated at 0.38% and production 0.12%.
        It is further assumed that about 30% of the produced water is discharged in
        surface water. Water emissions are differentiated between combined oil and
        gas production and gas production.

        Time period:  Energy demand is based on 2000 Norwegian data, quantity of flared
        gas on 1991 German data, leakages on 2000 data, quantity of discharged water
        and water emissions on 1991 German data.'

        Data for RU is mostly based on standard data, as only few information on the
        Russian production is available.

        Geography:  Data is based on average data and therefore not specific for the
        country, except for leakage data.

        Technology:  The data describes an average onshore technology for natural
        gas  to 13% out of combined oil gas production. Natural gas is assumed to
        20% sour. Leakage in exploitation is estimated at 0.38% and production 0.12%.
        It is further assumed that about 30% of the produced water is discharged in
        surface water. Water emissions are differentiated between combined oil and
        gas production and gas production.

        Time period:  Energy demand is based on 2000 Norwegian data, quantity of flared
        gas on 1991 German data, leakages on 2000 data, quantity of discharged water
        and water emissions on 1991 German data.'

      comment: 'This dataset represents the extraction of natural gas in the Russian
        Federation. Data stems from annual reports of oil and gas producers (Gazprom,
        Novatek, Likoil, Rusneft) and national GHG inventory (UNFCC).

        Geography:  Mostly Russion data. Also valid for countries with mere natural
        gas production and similar technology standard.

        Technology:  The data describes an average onshore technology for natural
        gas  with a share of 4% out of combined oil gas production and 96% from mere
        natural gas production. Natural gas is assumed to 20% sour. It is assumed
        that about 30% of the produced water is discharged in surface water. Water
        emissions are differentiated between combined oil and gas production and gas
        production.

        Time period:  Emissions to water are based on 1987 US data.'

        Data for RU is mostly based on standard data, as only few information on the
        Russian production is available.

        Geography:  Data is based on average data and therefore not specific for the
        country, except for leakage data.

        Technology:  The data describes an average onshore technology for natural
        gas  to 13% out of combined oil gas production. Natural gas is assumed to
        20% sour. Leakage in exploitation is estimated at 0.38% and production 0.12%.
        It is further assumed that about 30% of the produced water is discharged in
        surface water. Water emissions are differentiated between combined oil and
        gas production and gas production.

        Time period:  Energy demand is based on 2000 Norwegian data, quantity of flared
        gas on 1991 German data, leakages on 2000 data, quantity of discharged water
        and water emissions on 1991 German data.'

      comment: 'This dataset represents the production of natural gas on-shore in
        the United States in 2010.

        The datasets describes the extraction and the transformation processes, including
        sweetening. This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version
        2 but it has been adapted to split RNA into US and CA.


        It is based on NREL data ("Natural gas, at extraction site" and "Natural gas,
        processed, at plant" NREL 2007) and replaces the "natural gas production,
        RNA" dataset (as more specific data were available for canadian produciton).
        NREL data are split in extraction and processing but they have been joint
        to keep the same structure as other natural gas datasets in the database.
        Some flows have been extrapolated from the natural gas production in Germany.
        These data describe the gas production in US in general, so some flows may
        be over-estimated.

      comment: 'This dataset represents the construction of a run-of-river hydropower
        power plant in Quebec. This dataset is based on study on the production, transmission
        and distribution of electricity in Quebec. It represents an average of all
        the run-of-river power plants that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the main
        electricity provider in the region (about 95% of the total electricity produced).
        The inventory is based on a sample of 42 run-of-river power plants that combine
        for 13787MW, with different capacity (from 1800 MW to 4MW) and all the dams
        and derivations that were built to ensure the operation of the plants. Lifetime
        is assumed to be 100 years for the plant.  The data refers to plant construction
        of a mix of types of dams built between 1910 and 2014, therefore they might
        not be representative for an individual type of hydropower power plant. Lifetime
        is assumed to be 100 years for the plant and 50 for most of the equipments
        included (turbine-generator, valves, cranes, etc.)

        [This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It
        was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life
        Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected
        by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated
        following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been
        subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report
        (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/),
        and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes
        added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.
        The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of
        version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change
        report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion
        process.]

        Geography:  Data collected for Quebec

        Technology:  "The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams
        built between 1930 and 2011, therefore they might not be representative for
        an individual type of hydropower power plant.


        All the technologies (type of dam, type of turbine, etc.)  and capacities
        present in the region are included in the dataset.

        Several types of regulation works and dams are included (weight and vault
        concrete dams, morraine structures, etc.)"

        Time period:  Construction data collected for built power plants and infrastructures
        between 1930 and 2011 but assumed to be equivalent to present construction
        (energy, explosives and operations). Data for new plants were calculated by
        linear regression (based on installed power)'

        This study adresses Swiss and Austrian plants only. The data have been directly
        applied to preliminary describe plant-mixes in other countries. Only a representative
        sample of 5 run-of-river power plants in Switzerland and Austria is used for
        calculating the inputs. Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural
        part and 40 years for other materials. The data refer to the construction
        of a mix of 5 plants built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s, therefore
        they might not be representative for more modern construction, nor for an
        individual type.

        Geography:  Available data for a mix of plants in Switzerland and Austria,

      comment: "This dataset represents a run-of-river power plant unit for European\
        \ countries except from Switzerland. Due to the fact that this dataset is\
        \ based on data of Swiss and Austrian dams and then extrapolated to the rest\
        \ of Europe, the uncertainty is increased. A representative sample of various\
        \ types of power plants in Switzerland and Austria is taken into account.\
        \ The calculations are based on the information and data of the following\
        \ run-of-river power plants: Rupperswil-Auenstein (Baumann 1949), Wildegg-Brugg\
        \ (NOK 1956), Birsfelden (Aegerter et al. 1954), Donaukraftwerk Greifenstein\
        \ (Brux 1983; max. Leistung 237 MW) and Rheinkraftwerk Albbruck-Dogern (Radag\
        \ 1979) as well as the new construction of the power plant Ruppoldingen. The\
        \ determined specific data was then related to the entire power plant park\
        \ of Switzerland with an annual net electricity output of 15484 GWh/a (BEW\
        \ 2001a). Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part (including\
        \ cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation and explosives)\
        \ and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction\
        \ of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s;\
        \ therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction,\
        \ for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants. \n\
        [This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It\
        \ was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.\
        \ Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are\
        \ affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset\

        \ conversion process.]\nGeography:  The dataset represents the average of\
        \ a characteristic sample of run-of-river hydropower plants valid for European\
        \ conditions (i.e. all European countries modelled in ecoinvent with hydropower\
        \ except from Switzerland). \nTechnology:  References:\nK\xF6nig F., von (1985)\
        \ Bau von Wasserkraftanlagen. C.F. M\xFCller, Karlsruhe.\n\nRun-of-river power\
        \ plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs. Depending on\
        \ the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure\
        \ systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river\
        \ power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two\
        \ types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some\
        \ extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can\
        \ be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups\
        \ that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run\
        \ power stations.\n\nThe technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency\
        \ of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%.\
        \ The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the\
        \ efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the\
        \ turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern:\
        \ 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation\
        \ of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100%\
        \ is assumed.\n\nThe efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type\
        \ (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between\
        \ turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In K\xF6nig, examples\
        \ for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown.\
        \ For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines\
        \ show an efficiency of about 91%.\n\nThe efficiency of generators depends\
        \ on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system.\
        \ For today\u2019s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed,\
        \ modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers\
        \ amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.\n"

      comment: "This dataset represents a run-of-river power plant unit. For this,\
        \ a representative sample of various types of power plants in Switzerland\
        \ and Austria is taken into account. The calculations are based on the information\
        \ and data of the following run-of-river power plants: Rupperswil-Auenstein\
        \ (Baumann 1949), Wildegg-Brugg (NOK 1956), Birsfelden (Aegerter et al. 1954),\
        \ Donaukraftwerk Greifenstein (Brux 1983; max. Leistung 237 MW) and Rheinkraftwerk\
        \ Albbruck-Dogern (Radag 1979) as well as the new construction of the power\
        \ plant Ruppoldingen. The determined specific data was then related to the\
        \ entire power plant park of Switzerland with an annual net electricity output\
        \ of 15484 GWh/a (BEW 2001a). Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural\
        \ part (including cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation\
        \ and explosives) and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers\
        \ to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the\
        \ beginning of the 1980s; therefore they might not be representative for more\
        \ modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale\
        \ plants. \nGeography:  Data represent the average of a characteristic sample\
        \ of Swiss run-of-river hydropower plants.\nTechnology:  K\xF6nig F., von\
        \ (1985) Bau von Wasserkraftanlagen. C.F. M\xFCller, Karlsruhe.\nReferences:\n\
        \nRun-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs.\
        \ Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure\
        \ and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants\
        \ including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore\
        \ these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset.\
        \ To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems\
        \ can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups\
        \ that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run\
        \ power stations.\n\nThe technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency\
        \ of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%.\
        \ The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the\
        \ efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the\
        \ turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern:\
        \ 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation\
        \ of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100%\
        \ is assumed.\n\nThe efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type\
        \ (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between\
        \ turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In K\xF6nig, examples\
        \ for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown.\
        \ For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines\
        \ show an efficiency of about 91%.\n\nThe efficiency of generators depends\
        \ on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system.\
        \ For today\u2019s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed,\
        \ modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers\
        \ amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.\n"

          thus process water fractions to air are applied to all tap water input flows
          to calculate the amount of water consumed in the processes.

        The data on radioactive emission to air and water are from old references,
        but the range of values is relatively small. Only particle emission (here
        assumed dust >10 micrometer) to air is explicitly given in the used reference;
        emissions from combustion are implicitly accounted for through the energy
        requirement modules. The energy requirements are roughly divided into two:
        diesel in building machines to take into account the excavation of overburden
        with a mass ratio to product U3O8 of 30:1; and diesel in diesel generator
        for electricity uses, mostly for pumping water. It is assumed that the overburden
        and the ore piles that are not transfered to the mill plant, are dumped back
        in the pit. Reclamation of the pit is not included in the module because of
        lack of information. However, by far the largest masses of waste originating
        in mining are found in the mill tailings.

        The data on radioactive emission to air and water are from old references,
        but the range of values is relatively small. Only particle emission (here
        assumed dust >10 micrometer) to air is explicitly given in the used reference;
        emissions from combustion are implicitly accounted for through the energy
        requirement modules. The energy requirements are roughly divided into two:
        diesel in building machines to take into account the excavation of overburden
        with a mass ratio to product U3O8 of 30:1; and diesel in diesel generator
        for electricity uses, mostly for pumping water. It is assumed that the overburden
        and the ore piles that are not transfered to the mill plant, are dumped back
        in the pit. Reclamation of the pit is not included in the module because of
        lack of information. However, by far the largest masses of waste originating
        in mining are found in the mill tailings.

        The data on radioactive emission to air and water are from old references,
        but the range of values is relatively small. Only particle emission (here
        assumed dust >10 micrometer) to air is explicitly given in the used reference;
        emissions from combustion are implicitly accounted for through the energy
        requirement modules. The energy requirements are roughly divided into two:
        diesel in building machines to take into account the excavation of overburden
        with a mass ratio to product U3O8 of 30:1; and diesel in diesel generator
        for electricity uses, mostly for pumping water. It is assumed that the overburden
        and the ore piles that are not transfered to the mill plant, are dumped back
        in the pit. Reclamation of the pit is not included in the module because of
        lack of information. However, by far the largest masses of waste originating

        \ (Canada).  This dataset represents the CANDU technology (see nuclear plant\
        \ construction for details). Five plants work in Ontario (Pickering A and\
        \ B, Darlington and Bruce A and B), with a total installed power of 12781MW.\
        \ It is characterised by the use of heavy water (deuterium oxide) as moderator\
        \ and coolant and the use of natural uranium (not enriched) as fuel. This\

        \ available at: <http://portalweb.cammesa.com/Memnet1/default.aspx> Additional\
        \ information can be obtained from CAMMESA under request\nThis dataset represents\
        \ the production of high voltage electricity at a grid-connected nuclear pressurized\
        \ heavy water reactor (PHWR) power plant in Argentina in 2014. \nDuring the\
        \ reference year  three nuclear power plants operated in the country. Atucha\
        \ Nuclear Complex has two power stations, Atucha I (340 MW) and Atucha II\
        \ (692 MW), located on the right side of the Paran\xE1 de las Palmas River,\
        \ about 115 km northwest of the city of Buenos Aires. Atucha II reached its\
        \ first criticality in mid-2014, so the power generation of this plant during\
        \ the reference year of this study is limited.The third plant (600 MW) is\
        \ located in the town of Embalse, in the province of C\xF3rdoba. All of them\
        \ are PHWR, but the last one is a special type of PHWR developed in Canada,\
        \ known as CANDU (Canned Deuterium Uranium),  \nThis dataset has therefore\
        \ been constructed based on the CANDU technology. It is characterised by the\
        \ use of heavy water (deuterium oxide) as moderator and coolant and the use\
        \ of natural uranium (not enriched) as fuel. This dataset is based on the\
        \ database for  \"electricity production, nuclear, pressure water reactor,\
        \ heavy water moderated\"/ CA-QC 2015 (accessed: January 26th, 2018). Lifetime\
        \ is estimated to 30 years . Only main consumed products, wastes and emissions\
        \ are included. Operation data were collected for the nuclear production in\
        \ Argentina during 2014 period. All emission data have been taken from the\
        \ CA (Quebec) dataset.\nGeography:  Data extrapolated from Quebec dataset\
        \ and adapted for Argentina. Emissions have been taken from that dataset without\
        \ modification. Uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\nTechnology:  There\
        \ are three nuclear power plants in Argentina, all of them are pressurized\
        \ heavy water reactors (PHWR), characterized by the use of heavy water as\
        \ moderator and non-refined uranium as fuel. One of the Argentiean nuclear\
        \ power plants (Embalse power plant) is a 600 MW Canadian design (CANDU 6)\
        \ which uses the system of pressurized tubes.The other two PHWRs (Atucha 1\
        \ and Atucha 2) use presurized recipients instead.  This dataset is based\
        \ on the CANDU 6 technology. Some emission data were extrapolated from other\
        \ nuclear technology. Uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\nTime period:\
        \  The Annual Production Volume for Argentina is valid for the year 2014,\
        \ obtained from the national energy statistics (CAMMESA)"

        \ in a pressurized heavy water reactor nuclear plant. This dataset represents\
        \ the CANDU technology (see nuclear plant construction for details) and has\
        \ an installed power of 650MW (the average installed power for this technology).\
        \ It is characterised by the use of heavy water (deuterium oxide) as moderator\
        \ and coolant and the use of natural uranium (not enriched) as fuel. This\
        \ global dataset is extrapolated from the Quebec dataset, which is based on\
        \ study on the production, transport and distribution of electricity in Quebec.\
        \ It represents the production of Gentilly-2, the only nuclear plant in Quebec.\

        \ main consumed products, wastes and emissions are included. Operation data\
